# devserver_lib
devserver_lib does (nearly) the minimum necessary to serve a static folder over https://localhost:8080.

**DO NOT USE DEVSERVER_LIB IN PRODUCTION**

`devserver_lib` should only be used for locally hosting files on a trusted network. 

`devserver_lib` does not properly handle the attacks robust servers must withstand on an open network.

## usage
```rust
fn main() 
{
  devserver_lib::run(&"localhost", 8080, "", /*Auto-reload:*/ true ); // Runs forever serving the current folder on http://localhost:8080
}
```
